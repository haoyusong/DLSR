              IPv6 Domain Level Segment Routing using SRH
                         draft-song-dlsr-srh-00

Abstract

   A network may contain multiple domains or ASes under the control or
   coordination of the same entity.  This document describes the
   SRv6-based Domain-Level Segment Routing (DLSR).  Each domain or AS is
   virtualized as a single node and encoded as a Domain SID (DSID) in
   the existing Service Routing Header (SRH).

   The domains involved belong to a single Segment Routing Domain, as
   defined in RFC 8402.  DLSR can be used to better support end-to-end
   quality of service, traffic privacy and security, domain-level
   policy, and cross-domain traffic engineering.

1.  Introduction

   A network may contain multiple domains or ASes under the control or
   coordination of the same entity.  This document describes Domain-
   Level Segment Routing (DLSR) for SRv6.  Each domain or AS is
   virtualized as a single node and encoded as a Domain SID (DSID) in
   the existing Service Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8457].

   The domains involved belong to a single Segment Routing Domain, as
   defined in [RFC8402].  DLSR can be used to better support end-to-end
   quality of service, traffic privacy and security, domain-level
   policy, and cross-domain traffic engineering.

   DLSR is described in Section 2.  The DSID is specified in
   Section 2.1.  Examples of use cases are presented in Section 3.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC8402], [RFC8754],
   and [RFC8986].

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Domain Level Segment Routing

2.1.  Domain SID

   The format of the DSID is shown in Figure 1.


    0                                                              127
    +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
    |Prefix (variable)| Domain ID (32-bit)|    Function+Argument    |
    +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
    |<---- block  --->|<----- node ------>|
    |<----------- locator  -------------->|



                           Figure 1: DSID Format

   The locator (LOC) of the DSID is represented as B:N [RFC8986], where
   B (block/Prefix) is the IPv6 prefix allocated for DSIDs and N (node/
   Domain ID) is the identifier of the domain instantiating the SID.

   It is RECOMMENDED to use a globally-assigned (to the SR domain)
   Prefix to indicate the SID type is DSID.  The Domain ID is a 32-bit
   number that uniquely identifies a domain.  The Domain ID can be set
   to the autonomous system (AS) number [RFC6793].

   A DSID using a common locator should be advertised by all the Domain
   Border Routers (DBR) of the domain identified by the Domain ID.  The
   result is an anycast address to the domain.  Therefore, a packet
   destined to a DSID (i.e., the destination IP address in the routing
   table is the locator) can reach the domain through one of its DBRs,
   according to the routing computation result.

   The remaining bits can be used to encode functions and arguments for
   network programming.  The definition and use of any such behaviors
   are outside the scope of this document.

2.2.  Use of the Segment Routing Header (SRH)

   No changes are required to the SRH [RFC8754].  The segment list can
   contain only DSIDs to specify a pure domain-level path, loose or
   strict.  It can also contain a mix of SIDs in any number or order.

   The DSID of Domain ID X MUST NOT be routable within that domain.
   Therefore, an SR Node processing the SRv6 packet MUST drop it if the
   destination address (DA) would result from a DSID for the local
   Domain ID.

2.3.  DLSR Forwarding Examples

   In general, the SR Source Node [RFC8754] pushes an IPv6 header with
   its own SRH containing only a list of DSIDs or a mix with other SID
   types.  Figure 2 is the reference to describe the forwarding process
   using the abstract representation from [RFC8754].  The DSID for a
   Domain ID X is represented as ASX.  In Figure 2, all the nodes shown
   are DBRs and DLSR-capable.

   For example, host Src (in AS64500) sends a packet to host Dst (in
   AS64505) via an SR Policy <AS64501, AS64502, AS64505>, the packet is

   P1: (ASrc,AS64501)(ADst, AS64505, AS64502, AS64501; SL=3)

   Node x acts as transit node for packet P1 and forwards it towards
   AS64501.  In this case, there is only one DBR in AS64501 advertising
   the DSID (node a).

   Node a receives packet P1 and, using the logic in [RFC8754], sends
   packet

   P2: (ASrc,AS64502)(ADst, AS64505, AS64502, AS64501; SL=2)

   toward AS64502.  In this case, the internal metrics will determine
   the path toward DBR d, either through transit node b or transit nodes
   c and b.  Note that there wasn't a connection between AS64501 and
   AS64502, or DBR d didn't advertise the DSID (but DBR k did) then the
   packet would be forwarded through AS64503 and AS64504.

   Node d receives packet P2 and, using the logic in [RFC8754], sends
   packet

   P3: (ASrc,AS64505)(ADst, AS64505, AS64502, AS64501; SL=1)

   toward AS64505.  In this case, the internal metrics will determine
   the path toward DBR y, either through transit node e or transit nodes
   k and e.  Note that there wasn't a connection between AS64502 and
   AS64505, or DBR y didn't advertise the DSID (but DBR z did) then the
   packet would be forwarded through AS64504.

   Node y receives packet P3 and, using the logic in [RFC8754], sends
   packet

   P4: (ASrc,ADst)(ADst, AS64505, AS64502, AS64501; SL=0)

   on the interface toward Dst.

   In another example, host Src sends a packet to host Dst via an SR
   Policy <AS64503, Ae>, the packet is

   P5: (ASrc,AS64503)(ADst,Ae,A64503; SL=2)

   Nodes x, a, and c act as transit nodes for packet P5 and forward it
   towards AS64503.

   Node f receives packet P5 and, using the logic in [RFC8754], sends
   packet

   P6: (ASrc,Ae)(ADst,Ae,A64503; SL=1)

   toward node e.  In this case, the shortest/best path to reach node e
   is through AS64504.  Nodes g, h, i, and k act as transit nodes for
   packet P6.

   Node e receives packet P6 and, using the logic in [RFC8754], sends
   packet

   P7: (ASrc,ADst)(ADst,Ae,A64503; SL=0)

   toward AS64505, where node Dst is located.

   Note that if the Penultimate Segment Pop (PSP) behavior [RFC8986] is
   used, node e can remove the SRH before forwarding the packet to node
   Dst.

2.4.  DLSR SRH Compression

   DLSR SIDs share the common prefix, and each has a 32-bit domain ID,
   so both NEXT-C-SID flavor and REPLACE-C-SID flavor as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression] can be supported to reduce the
   SRH overhead.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  End-to-End Cross-Domain QoS

   Cross-domain QoS is a long-standing problem.  It needs a solution for
   the emerging Internet-scale applications such as metaverse, 3D live
   events, and remote interactive operations.  In the current Internet,
   since the accountable entity such as domain is invisible at data
   plane, it is difficult to assign the responsibilities and attribute
   the service results.  By supporting domain-level routing and
   forwarding, a business model can be fostered to enable Internet-scale
   end-to-end QoS with the right level of manageable entity.  The
   limited number of "hops" corresponds to the service providers who
   have vested interests to support the value-added services and full
   control of the means to achieve the QoS goal.  The domain level
   routing and forwarding also decouple the intra-domain and inter-
   domain, allowing each domain operator to independently innovate on
   intra-domain traffic engineering and forwarding optimizations.  The
   explicit domain boundary also allows the existing OAM standards and
   tools to be applied at the domain level by considering each domain as
   a node, making domain-level SLA auditable.

3.2.  Traffic Security and Privacy

   For various business or legal reasons, certain customer traffic must
   be retained within specific domains.  On the other hand, due to
   disaster, outrage, and other political reasons, certain customer
   traffic must avoid specific domains.  By specifying a domain-level
   path, one can avoid or include domains for any security and privacy
   reasons.  One can also guide traffic to certain domains for special
   treatments such as security screening and lawful interception.

3.3.  Domain Level Routing Policy

   With a domain-level path, we can directly express the peering and
   routing preferences at data plane.  Domain-level routing policies are
   easy to be specified.  For example, we can pin certain traffic to a
   specific domain where one of the anycast destinations is located.

3.4.  Domain Level Traffic Engineering

   One can provision multiple domain-level paths with the same of
   different service level.  Path choosing or load balancing can be
   applied on these paths to achieve the ideal performance.

3.5.  Service Function Chaining (SFC)

   Domain level source routing allows service providers to collaborate
   on providing distributed network services.  SFC is a general
   technique to initiate an ordered set of service functions (e.g.,
   firewall, load balancing, WAN optimization, NAT, and encryption) in
   network and steer the user traffic through it.  Traditionally it can
   only be used by a single service provider.  With DLSR, it is easier
   to negotiate a plan to allocate different network functions in
   different domains.  The service providers are compensated by the
   nature of the functions and the contribution of each participating
   domain.  The SFC descriptor (e.g., NSH [RFC8300]) can be carried as a
   SRH option.

3.6.  Path Validation

   DLSR provides a natural way to support path validation at the domain
   level.  The path information is kept in the SRH and can be verified
   at each segment endpoint.  Various verification algorithms and
   protocols can be used (e.g., IOAM POT [RFC9197]).

3.7.  Hierarchical Segment Routing

   When the SR domain covers multiple ASes, DLSR can be used to
   effectively reduce the packet overhead and protect the privacy.  In
   this case, the packet is forwarded at the domain level.  Each DSID is
   configured as a binding SID, so at each domain border, a local SR
   policy is applied to tunnel through the domain.  On the data plane,
   any domain do not know the policy of the other domains.

4.  Security Considerations

   Considering that the intent of the DSID is to be used inside a single
   SR domain, the security considerations from [RFC8402], [RFC8754], and
   [RFC8986] apply.

   In DLSR, one participating AS is considered a single node in the SR
   domain, so the SR domain is beyond the control of any single AS, and
   an entity at the SR domain level is needed to oversee the domain-
   level path provision, or stricter security and authentication
   measurements need to be applied to avoid any abuse or attack.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
