              IPv6 Domain Level Segment Routing using SRH
                         draft-song-dlsr-srh-00

Abstract

   We propose to make network domains as an explicit entity for packet
   forwarding, in order to better support end-to-end quality of service,
   traffic privacy and security, domain-level policy, and cross-domain
   traffic engineering.  In the context of IPv6, the Domain-Level
   Segment Routing (DLSR) can be considered as a special case of SRv6,
   in which each domain is virtualized as a single node and encoded as a
   Domain SID (DSID).  SRH is used to support DLSR, and DSIDs can be
   mixed with any other types of SIDs in an SRH.  DLSR allows each
   domain to hide its intra-domain routing/forwarding details and be
   managed and monitored as a whole.  The scheme is compatible with IPv6
   and SRv6 architecture.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet is a network of networks, in which each basic network,
   known as an Autonomous Domain (AS), is independently operated by an
   Internet Service Provider (ISP).  Although used by the inter-domain
   routing protocol Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), ASes are invisible in
   the forwarding plane, to both end-hosts and routers.  At each router
   in the Internet, packet forwarding is based on a Forwarding

   Information Base (FIB), which only provides the next hop (i.e., a
   next immediate router towards the destination) information, without
   showing which domain the packet is from, in, and to.  Such a flat
   forwarding architecture misses some opportunities to achieve certain
   high-level goals of forwarding.

   The AS or domain (we will use domain interchangeably with the term AS
   hereafter) sets a clear boundary for responsibility.  The service
   provider of a domain can make decision on peering agreements and
   various routing policies, and take charge of intra-domain routing and
   forwarding schemes.  In the seven layers of networking model, domain
   can be naturally considered as a sub-layer located between Layer 3
   (i.e., network layer) and Layer 4 (i.e., transport layer).  In the
   past few years, it has been suggested to introduce the Layer 3.5
   (L3.5) into the protocol stack as a means to de-ossify the Internet
   architecture by removing the IP protocol as the thin waist at L3.
   However, even without the ambitious goal, the introduction of the
   Layer 3.5 is still beneficial in the context of the IP networks.  For
   example, the hierarchical layer separation may simplify the routing
   and forwarding; at the domain level, fewer entities need to be dealt
   with on a forwarding path and each entity happens to correspond to a
   single accountable operator; the new overlay can hide the underlay
   details so the intra-domain routing and forwarding can be kept as
   internal procedure for good reasons.

   The IP network is migrating to IPv6.  IPv6 was designed to be
   extensible with the Extension Header (EH) mechanism [RFC8200].  EH is
   conveniently located between the base IPv6 header (L3) and the
   transport protocol header (L4), suitable for a L3.5 header.  A
   Routing Header (RH) is specified as an EH type.  SRv6 [RFC8754] has
   taken advantage of it to support a flavor of node-level source
   routing on IPv6 data plane using an RH type named SRH.  With great
   extensibility and programmability, SRv6 has shown potential in
   supporting new services, making the network intelligent and
   simplifying the network protocols.  It is crucial to take advantage
   of its momentum and exploit its extensibility to make it even more
   powerful.

   With the domain as the explicit L3.5 entity, we can take a simplified
   view of the Internet by considering each domain as a virtual router
   (i.e., each domain is virtualized as a single node).  The physical
   Domain Border Routers (DBRs) are considered as the virtual router
   interfaces, and all the other intra-domain routers of a domain
   resemble the switch fabric of the corresponding virtual router.  In
   this model, each virtual router can be identified by a domain ID
   (i.e., the AS number).  A packet destined to a virtual router will be
   processed by an ingress DBR of the corresponding domain where local
   intra-domain policies can be applied (note that the local policy can

   be opaque to the controller outside of the domain).  Each virtual
   router's performance is individually monitored and measured.  Such an
   abstraction allows us to easily reuse the existing OAM protocols and
   tools, yet at the domain level instead of the physical router level.

   Under such a model, it is easy to fit the domain-level routing and
   forwarding in the framework of SRv6 by deeming a domain as a segment
   endpoint.  From the SRv6's perspective, a domain-level segment has no
   difference from a physical node-level segment.  We only need to
   specify a new type of SID to encode the domain, and then we can use
   it in SRH to support Domain-Level Segment Routing (DLSR).  In this
   document, we describe the Domain SID (DSID) encoding, explain the
   DLSR processing and forwarding procedure with examples, and discuss
   the major use cases of DLSR.  We show DLSR is fully compatible with
   IPv6 and SRv6 architecture.  It introduces a new hierarchical
   structure and a new semantics to SRv6, and therefore enables new
   services.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

      DLSR - Domain-Level Source Routing

      DSID - Domain Segment ID

2.  Domain Level Segment Routing

2.1.  Domain SID

   The format of the DSID is shown in Figure 1.  The prefix is globally
   assigned to indicate the SID type is of domain.  Following the prefix
   is 32-bit domain ID which is used to uniquely identify a domain.  The
   domain ID can be set the same as the AS number.  The remaining part
   is used to encode functions and arguments for network programming.


    0                                                              127
    +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
    |Prefix (variable)| Domain ID (32-bit)|    Function+Argument    |
    +-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------+
    |<---- block  --->|<----- node ------>|
    |<----------- locator  -------------->|



                           Figure 1: DSID Format

Internet-Draft                  DLSR SRH                   November 2023


   The locator part of the DSID is considered as an anycast address of
   the domain which is advertised externally by all the DBRs of the
   domain.  Therefore, a packet destined to a domain-level segment
   (i.e., the destination IP address is a DSID) can reach the domain
   through one of its DBRs according to the routing computation result.

   The remaining part of the DSID can be used to encode the QoS
   requirements or for other uses.  The encoding of this part is out of
   the scope of this document.

2.2.  SRH for DLSR

   The SRH format for DLSR is identical to the standard format as
   specified in [RFC8754].  The segment list can have mixed DSIDs and
   other types of SIDs in arbitrary number and order.  An SRH can
   specify a pure domain-level path in the sense of either strict or
   loose source routing.  It is also possible to specify a path mixed
   with domains and physical nodes for extended flexibility.  However,
   since a DSID represents a domain, a few rules need to be observed
   when specifying a path to guarantee the correct semantics.

   *  The DSID of a domain X is not routable within X.  Therefore, the
      next segment endpoint of a physical node in X MUST not be the DSID
      of X.

   *  The next segment endpoint of a domain-level segment endpoint
      should usually be located outside of the domain, because the
      entire domain is considered as a single endpoint.

   *  An exception to the above rule is that: the last segment endpoint
      (i.e., the final destination) can be within a domain-level segment
      endpoint.  This is usually used for strict DLSR where the complete
      domain-level path is specified.

2.3.  DLSR Forwarding Examples

   The path head end inserts the SRH to the packet.  In the case of
   strict path DLSR, assume the domain-level path length is N (include
   the source domain and the destination domain), we set SL = N-1.  We
   use an example shown in Figure 2 to describe the forwarding process
   for the strict path DLSR.

                   Figure 2: DLSR Forwarding Example I

   Assume the source node Src in AS0 would send a packet to the
   destination node Dst in AS3 and it acquires a strict DLSR path <AS1,
   AS2, AS5>.  The packet at Src is formatted as (Src, AS1)(Dst, AS5,
   AS2, AS1; SL=3).  The packet is forwarded to DBR 'a'.  At 'a', the
   packet is updated to (Src, AS2)(Dst, AS5, AS2, AS1; SL=2), and
   forwarded to 'd'.  At 'd', the packet is updated to (Src, AS5)(Dst,
   AS5, AS2, AS1; SL=1) and forwarded to 'y'.  At 'y', the packet is
   updated to (Src, Dst)(Dst, AS5, AS2, AS1; SL=0) and forwarded to Dst.

   The ingress DBR of a domain-level segment endpoint also processes the
   functions and parameters carried in the DSID, as well as the optional
   TLVs carried in the SRH.

   In more general cases, domain-level segments can be mixed with node-
   level segments for more flexible forwarding.  For example, in
   Figure 2, if a path <AS3, e> is configured for a packet from Src to
   Dst, the packet at Src is formatted as (Src, AS3)(Dst, e, AS3; SL=2)
   and forwarded to 'f'.  At 'f'. the packet is updated to (Src, e)(Dst,
   e, AS3; SL=1) and forwarded to 'e'.  At 'e', the packet is updated to
   (Src, Dst)(Dst, e, AS3; SL=0) and forwarded to Dst. Note that if the
   Penultimate Hop Popping (PHP) behavior is preferred, Node 'e' can
   remove the SRH before forwarding the packet to Dst.

2.4.  DLSR SRH Compression

   DLSR SIDs share the common prefix, and each has a 32-bit domain ID,
   so both NEXT-C-SID flavor and REPLACE-C-SID flavor as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-srh-compression] can be supported to reduce the
   SRH overhead.

2.5.  Domain-level Segment vs. Node-level Segment

   To some extent, a domain-level segment is equivalent to two node-
   level segments (one for the domain ingress DBR and the other for the
   domain egress DBR).  However, each domain only needs a globally
   unique SID to represent but it may have many ingress and egress DBRs.
   Using a domain-level segment is more compact than using two node-
   level segments, and support multihoming without exposing the domain
   topology and configuration.  Moreover, a domain-level segment
   unambiguously defines the domain boundary (the node-level segment
   lacks such a feature) so the use cases discussed in Section 3 can be
   easily supported.

   Although the DSID can also be used as a binding SID to bind some
   local policy as configured by the global controller, in practice, the
   intra-domain forwarding scheme and policy are preferred to be kept
   private and controlled locally.  The domain-level segment makes such
   provision straightforward.

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  End-to-End Cross-Domain QoS

   Cross-domain QoS is a long-standing problem.  It needs a solution for
   the emerging Internet-scale applications such as metaverse, 3D live
   events, and remote interactive operations.  In the current Internet,
   since the accountable entity such as domain is invisible at data
   plane, it is difficult to assign the responsibilities and attribute
   the service results.  By supporting domain-level routing and
   forwarding, a business model can be fostered to enable Internet-scale
   end-to-end QoS with the right level of manageable entity.  The
   limited number of "hops" corresponds to the service providers who
   have vested interests to support the value-added services and full
   control of the means to achieve the QoS goal.  The domain level
   routing and forwarding also decouple the intra-domain and inter-
   domain, allowing each domain operator to independently innovate on
   intra-domain traffic engineering and forwarding optimizations.  The
   explicit domain boundary also allows the existing OAM standards and
   tools to be applied at the domain level by considering each domain as
   a node, making domain-level SLA auditable.

3.2.  Traffic Security and Privacy

   For various business or legal reasons, certain customer traffic must
   be retained within specific domains.  On the other hand, due to
   disaster, outrage, and other political reasons, certain customer
   traffic must avoid specific domains.  By specifying a domain-level
   path, one can avoid or include domains for any security and privacy
   reasons.  One can also guide traffic to certain domains for special
   treatments such as security screening and lawful interception.

3.3.  Domain Level Routing Policy

   With a domain-level path, we can directly express the peering and
   routing preferences at data plane.  Domain-level routing policies are
   easy to be specified.  For example, we can pin certain traffic to a
   specific domain where one of the anycast destinations is located.

3.4.  Domain Level Traffic Engineering

   One can provision multiple domain-level paths with the same of
   different service level.  Path choosing or load balancing can be
   applied on these paths to achieve the idea performance.

3.5.  Service Function Chaining (SFC)

   Domain level source routing allows service providers to collaborate
   on providing distributed network services.  SFC is a general
   technique to initiate an ordered set of service functions (e.g.,
   firewall, load balancing, WAN optimization, NAT, and encryption) in
   network and steer the user traffic through it.  Traditionally it can
   only be used by a single service provider.  With DLSR, it is easier
   to negotiate a plan to allocate different network functions in
   different domains.  The service providers are compensated by the
   nature of the functions and the contribution of each participating
   domain.  The SFC descriptor (e.g., NSH [RFC8300]) can be carried as a
   SRH option.

3.6.  Path Validation

   DLSR provides a natural way to support path validation at the domain
   level.  The path information is kept in the SRH and can be verified
   at each segment endpoint.  Various verification algorithms and
   protocols can be used (e.g., IOAM POT [RFC9197]).

Internet-Draft                  DLSR SRH                   November 2023


3.7.  Hierarchical Segment Routing

   When the SR domain covers multiple ASes, DLSR can be used to
   effectively reduce the packet overhead and protect the privacy.  In
   this case, the packet is forwarded at the domain level.  Each DSID is
   configured as a binding SID, so at each domain border, a local SR
   policy is applied to tunnel through the domain.  On the data plane,
   any domain do not know the policy of the other domains.

4.  Security Considerations

   DLSR shares all the security considerations for SRv6.  In DLSR, one
   AS is considered a single node in the SR domain, so the SR domain is
   beyond the control of any single AS.  It is conceivable a higher
   level entity may be needed to oversee the domain-level path
   provision, or stricter security and authentication measurements need
   to be applied to avoid any abuse or attack.

   IETF has assembled a team of expert to provide a solid security
   analysis of SRv6.  The output is applicable to DLSR as well, and DLSR
   also provides new perspective for analysis.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
